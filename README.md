# 🐭 Sweet Deal

**Sweet Deal** is a fast-paced stealth arcade game created for the **Brackeys Game Jam**, where you play as a tiny mouse on a dangerous sugar heist mission.

Your goal is simple — steal as many cookies as you can from a cursed dungeon filled with cookie monsters… and survive.

But in a world where even desserts bite back, every step can be your last.
